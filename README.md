# Interactive Scene And Electronics Integration

Our current interactive scene is a simple red box sprite that can be controlled by input from the joystick, and a green circle that appears when you press a button, both are connected to the Arduino Board. 
The current goal is simply to move around and press the button, and it's purpose is to show users that the current controller has functionality for both button and joystick style input.

In the future we will create a simple 2D platformer allowing the player to move left and right (sliding the board), and jump (button). The player will have to avoid 
or destroy enemies, with enemies able to kill the player, and the player winning when they get through all of the enemies to the far right side of the level.
